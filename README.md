# A COMPLETE REPOSITORY OF HOW & WHERE MY GO JOURNEY BEGAN

## THE BEGINNING 

**Started GO at Learn2Earn**
- At learn2earn was my first exposure to the GO programming language, where i had to pass through a module called *piscine-go*. There i was tasked with different DSA's quest and did some project.

- This repository contains all GO projects(that aren't made private) i have worked on.

- You might see some of this project as a stand-alone repo in my github account, but i will still be adding them to this *repository* for easy access and navigation.

## projects in this repository
- pisine-go
- sudoku-solver
- GO-with-Joseph-Abah

### PISCINE-GO
This project consist of my though journey through Learn2Earn selection phase system. I had to collaborate with other participants i know not of, to build project, went through aduits and also rigorous weekly checkpoints with miscellenous exercises.

**Things I Got To Learn**
- How to work with CLI(on ubuntu)
- The essentials of shell
- The fundamentals of GO programming
- How to create a sudoku solver
- A system that uses characters to form a shape i.e *Quad*
- Created a pattern recognition system i.e *quad checker*
- A sudoku solver (refer to the "L2E sudoku-solver")
